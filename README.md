## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a **scalable, enterprise-ready end-to-end automation framework** built using **Playwright and TypeScript**, supporting **UI automation, API automation, and full E2E workflows** within a single unified solution.

The framework follows **industry best practices** such as **Page Object Model (POM)** for UI automation and **client–helper architecture** for API testing. It leverages **AI-assisted utilities** to accelerate test development, improve assertion quality, and enhance long-term maintainability.

Designed for real-world production use, the framework supports **cross-browser testing**, **REST API CRUD automation**, **authentication handling**, **schema validation**, **environment-based execution**, and **seamless CI/CD integration**.
